```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Application :rocket:
To run the application, run the following command:

I suggest to use the python -B flag to not generate the bytecode cache. It ensures that any changes made to the code will be reflected in the next run, without having to manually delete the bytecode cache. 

```
python -B -m gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py run:app
```
or for running with werkzeug:
```
python run.py
```

Access the application in your browser using the URL:

### Running the Docker
Dockerfile for creating a Docker image yourself  
Then we can create an image using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mylinde/freegpt.git && cd freegpt
```

Build image:
```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t freegpt .
```

Run the application using Docker:
```
docker run -p 1338:1338 freegpt:latest
